Will Russia successfully land on the Moon with their first attempt?,"This question resolves Yes if Russia successfully lands on the Moon with their first attempt. As a first attempt, we count the first mission to achieve liftoff with a lunar lander on board and the stated intention to land the lander on the moon.

If the launch is aborted or if there is a malfunction preventing the rocket from launching, but this first spaceship and first lander are intact and will be used in another launch, this next launch will still count as the first attempt.
The lander must touch the ground in a controlled and gradual way that does not damage all of its systems to the point of being inoperable. If some but not all systems are damaged during the landing, but the lander can still perform some of its tasks with its onboard equipment and Roscosmos is able to communicate with the lander after the landing, then it will qualify as a successful landing and the question will resolve Yes.
