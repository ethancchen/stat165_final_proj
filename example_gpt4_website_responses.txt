Prompt:
Here is a forecasting question: Will advanced LIGO announce discovery of gravitational waves by Jan. 31 2016?

Here are the resolution criteria of the question: The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) re-opened in mid September after a significant upgrade.
Designed with 10x greater sensitivity and a wider range of covered frequencies than the original LIGO, advanced LIGO should, according to its designers, have an "enhanced physics reach that during its first several hours of operation will exceed the integrated observations of the 1 year LIGO Science Run."
A full description of the experiment in gory detail can be found here.
Calculations of the expected detection rates suggest tens and potentially hundreds of detectable events per year under reasonable assumptions about neutron star and other types of binaries (and of course assuming General Relativity is correct, etc.)
Will the LIGO experiment publicly announce a 5-sigma (or equivalent) discovery of astrophysical gravitational waves by Jan 31, 2016?.

Based on the forecasting question and resolution criteria, generate low quality step-by-step reasoning to create a resolution. Output only steps without an introduction or a conclusion.


Response:
1. Advanced LIGO's Features: Note that Advanced LIGO has 10x greater sensitivity and a wider range of frequencies, suggesting it could detect gravitational waves more effectively.
2. Claims of Enhanced Detection Capability: Consider that Advanced LIGO is expected to achieve significant observational milestones quickly due to its enhanced capabilities.
3. Detection Rate Projections: Reference the predictions that tens to hundreds of events could be detected each year, indicating a high likelihood of detection.
4. Timeline for Announcements: Assume that since detections are expected to be frequent, an announcement by January 31, 2016, could be plausible.
5. Technical and Operational Issues: Briefly acknowledge that technical or operational issues could delay an announcement but not delve into specifics or likelihoods.
6. Simplistic Probability Assumption: Conclude that the combination of enhanced sensitivity and high expected detection rates makes an announcement likely by the specified date.

Response:
Based on the forecasting question and resolution criteria, generate high quality step-by-step reasoning to create a resolution. Output only steps without an introduction or a conclusion.
1. Evaluate Technological Enhancements: Assess the specific technological improvements made to Advanced LIGO, focusing on the tenfold increase in sensitivity and the expansion in the frequency range. Understand how these enhancements could potentially boost the chances of detecting gravitational waves.
2. Analyze Expected Detection Rates: Examine the calculations provided by the LIGO team, which predict the detection of tens to hundreds of events per year. Consider how these rates are calculated, including the assumptions about neutron star binaries and other celestial bodies.
3. Review Historical Performance and Upgrades Impact: Look into the historical data of LIGO before the upgrade, noting any past detections or lack thereof. Compare this to the expected performance improvements post-upgrade, considering the enhanced sensitivity and frequency range.
4. Understand the Significance of a 5-Sigma Discovery: Clarify what a 5-sigma level of confidence means in the context of this experimentâ€”essentially, this would require the event to have a probability of being a false signal of less than one in 3.5 million.
5. Timeline for Detection to Announcement: Analyze the typical timeline from detection of a potential gravitational wave to the public announcement. This involves data collection, analysis, verification, and possibly peer review, which could influence whether an announcement would be made by the specified date.
6. Consider External and Operational Factors: Identify any external or operational factors that could affect the timeline or success rate, such as technical malfunctions, calibration issues, or funding disruptions.
7. Probability and Forecasting Models: Use statistical methods or simulation models to estimate the likelihood of detecting and announcing a gravitational wave discovery by the end of January 2016, based on the improved capabilities and expected event rates.
8. Consult Expert Opinions and Precedents: Consider the opinions of physicists and astronomers who specialize in gravitational waves to gauge consensus expectations about LIGO's capabilities and timelines. Also, review any similar historical precedents in physics where significant discoveries were made shortly after major technological upgrades.
