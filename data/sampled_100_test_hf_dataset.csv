"Will the Black Sea grain deal be extended before July 19, 2023?","This question will resolve as Yes if, before July 19, 2023, credible sources report that the Black Sea Grain Initiative has been extended beyond the current end date of July 18, 2023. To qualify, both Ukraine and Russia must agree to the extension; if it is reported that the deal has been extended but either Ukraine or Russia is no longer a party to the agreement then the question will resolve as No.
Fine Print
This question will still resolve as Yes even if the extension is reported to alter the original terms, so long as credible sources refer to the Black Sea Grain Initiative as being extended. If there are conflicting reports or statements Metaculus will rely primarily on official statements from the United Nations and may resolve the question as Ambiguous if the situation is unclear."

If a party which is not listed wins the highest number of seats, all questions will resolve as No.

If no parliamentary election occurs before January 1, 2024, all questions will be Annulled. If there are two or more parliamentary elections in 2023, only the first election will be considered by this question.

Will Peter Bone MP be suspended from Parliament in 2023 (without first resigning)?,"This question will resolve as Yes, if Peter Bone MP is suspended from Parliament for any reason before January 1, 2024, as reported by credible sources.
Fine Print
A suspension for any length of time is sufficient to resolve as Yes.
Removal from a party or other duties does not qualify, only being suspended as a MP from the House of Commons is sufficient.
If Peter Bone resigns from the House of Commons before he is suspended this question will resolve as No."
Will Russia successfully land on the Moon with their first attempt?,"This question resolves Yes if Russia successfully lands on the Moon with their first attempt. As a first attempt, we count the first mission to achieve liftoff with a lunar lander on board and the stated intention to land the lander on the moon. This will be considered the ""first attempt"" even if Roscosmos decides at any point not to attempt the landing.
If there is a failure preventing liftoff from happening it will count as a failure of the mission and the question will resolve as No only if the spaceship or lander are destroyed or lost. If the launch is aborted or if there is a malfunction preventing the rocket from launching, but this first spaceship and first lander are intact and will be used in another launch, this next launch will still count as the first attempt.
The lander must touch the ground in a controlled and gradual way that does not damage all of its systems to the point of being inoperable. If some but not all systems are damaged during the landing, but the lander can still perform some of its tasks with its onboard equipment and Roscosmos is able to communicate with the lander after the landing, then it will qualify as a successful landing and the question will resolve Yes.
The landing must be confirmed by credible media sources.
This question resolves No if Russia‚Äôs first attempt to land on the Moon fails.
Fine Print
In the unlikely case of Roscosmos or any Russian officials claiming that the landing was successful but this claim is being challenged by other countries' space agencies or by credible media sources, then the question will resolve ambiguously unless Metaculus Admins decide that the evidence provided by one side is proof which removes any reasonable doubt (something like NASA images of the crashed lander or images of the intact lander taken from orbit or from the surface of the Moon taken by the lander if their authenticity is independently confirmed)."

Fine Print
If the divisional round of the 2023-2024 NFL playoffs is not held by April 1, 2024, or is officially cancelled, all teams will resolve as Annulled.

If Chevron and Offshore Alliance reach an agreement to delay the commencement of industrial actions until after September 25, 2023, for any reason, this question will resolve as Yes.
