Based on the forecasting question and resolution criteria, generate low quality step-by-step reasoning to create a resolution. Output exactly 6 steps without an introduction or a conclusion.","1. **Understanding the Deadline and Operational Timeline**: Advanced LIGO resumed operations in mid-September 2015. By the date mentioned in the question, January 31, 2016, this provides a window of approximately 4.5 months for the observatory to detect gravitational waves. The first step is to evaluate whether this timeframe aligns with expected observational capabilities and peak operational performance after the upgrades.

2. **Considering the Enhanced Sensitivity and Frequency Range**: Advanced LIGO's upgrade increased its sensitivity tenfold and expanded its frequency range. This enhancement significantly increases the probability of detecting gravitational waves within a short period. Notably, the statement from the LIGO team indicates that the improved system could surpass the observation outcomes of previous extensive science runs within just hours of operation. This claim supports the potential for a discovery to be made within the given timeline.

3. **Analyzing Expected Detection Rates**: According to predictions based on the new specifications of advanced LIGO, detection of gravitational waves could range from tens to hundreds of events per year. Even with conservative estimates, the likelihood of detecting at least one event in the expanded dataset and sensitivity range during the initial months of operation appears reasonable.

4. **Understanding 5-Sigma Confidence Level for Discovery Announcement**: A 5-sigma confidence level is a statistical measure that equates to a probability of about 1 in 3.5 million against a false positive. Achieving this threshold is crucial for a definitive discovery announcement. This factor must be considered as it requires not only the detection of the signal but also thorough validation and analysis to rule out noise and confirm the source and integrity of the signal.

5. **Considering Historical Context and Predictive Modeling**: Previous operations and experiments by the original LIGO and other observatories had set high standards and gathered significant amounts of data, honing the approaches used in gravitational wave astronomy. The updated technology combined with advanced predictive models and simulations further boost the confidence in making a notable discovery.

6. **Estimating the Public Announcement Timing**: Lastly, even if a potential gravitational wave is detected, there is a necessity for verification, data analysis, and peer review before making a public announcement. Given the January 31, 2016 deadline, LIGO teams would be under pressure to complete these processes. The likelihood of an announcement would depend not only on detecting a wave but also on the efficiency and speed of the subsequent validation process. Based on the ambitious upgrades and enhanced operational capabilities, an announcement by the given date, if a gravitational wave is detected early in the operational window, remains plausible.","1. Determine if LIGO is operational: Check if the Advanced LIGO has indeed been operational since mid-September as noted. This involves looking up recent news or official announcements about its operational status.

2. Review detection capability: Consider the enhanced sensitivity of the newly upgraded Advanced LIGO to understand its potential in detecting gravitational waves. Its 10x sensitivity might lead to capturing more events.

3. Calculate the expected rate of discoveries: Since estimates suggest that there are tens to hundreds of detectable events per year, divide these numbers by 12 to get a rough monthly estimate.

4. Confirm the level of needed evidence: Ensure whether required detection must meet a 5-sigma level of confidence. This statistical standard is crucial for validating scientific discoveries to rule out random occurrences.

5. Monitor announcements: Regularly check LIGO’s official channels and major scientific news sources for any announcements regarding the discovery of gravitational waves.

6. Date check: As of the cutoff date of January 31, 2016, see if any discoveries that meet these criteria have been announced. If yes, then Advanced LIGO has met the requirement of the forecast question. If no, then it hasn’t yet within the given timeframe."

In their announcemend dated 10/15/14 they suggested a one-year timeframe for developing a test, and a 5-year timeframe for a prototype device. Similar predictions were made in a recent article.
As of 1/2/16 this effort is still featured on the Lockheed Martin website.
WIll they announce a successful test of a break-even device by April 15, 2019?.

Based on the forecasting question and resolution criteria, generate low quality step-by-step reasoning to create a resolution. Output exactly 6 steps without an introduction or a conclusion.","1. Review the original timeline and promises made by Lockheed Martin and its Skunkworks division in relation to the development of the compact fusion reactor, as outlined in their October 15, 2014 announcement. According to the announcement, a significant test was projected to occur within a year (by October 2015), and a prototype device was anticipated within five years (by October 2019).

2. Investigate any updates, progress reports, press releases, or interviews given by Lockheed Martin regarding the compact fusion reactor project after January 2, 2016. This may involve checking Lockheed Martin's official website, their press release archives, and reputable news outlets covering topics in technology and energy.

3. Assess the technological challenges associated with creating a compact fusion reactor, particularly achieving a break-even point where the energy output equals the energy input. Scientific and technical assessments from experts in the field can provide insight into whether the timeline Lockheed Martin initially proposed was realistic.

4. Consider general progress in the field of fusion energy up to April 15, 2019, recognizing that break-even fusion technology has historically faced many challenges and delays. Analyze whether any groundbreaking advancements or setbacks in the broader fusion energy community could have impacted Lockheed Martin's project timelines.

5. Verify whether Lockheed Martin has made any announcements specifically referencing a successful break-even test of their compact fusion reactor by April 15, 2019. This would involve searching for press releases dated before or on April 15, 2019, and checking for unambiguous statements confirming that a break-even test was successfully conducted.

6. Summarize the findings from these investigations to conclude whether Lockheed Martin and Skunkworks have indeed announced a successful test of a break-even compact fusion reactor by the stipulated date of April 15, 2019. If no such announcement can be verified, then based on available information, the answer would be that they did not achieve this milestone within the timeframe expected.","1. Start by searching for any news updates on Lockheed Martin’s Skunkworks program specifically related to their compact fusion reactor since the last known update on their website as of January 2, 2016. Ignore other sources' credibility or any detailed scientific evaluations of the updates.

2. Check Lockheed Martin’s official website and social media pages for press releases or updates around April 15, 2019, without confirming the authenticity or context of a break-even test.

3. Look into online forums and social media to see if there are any unofficial reports or rumors about the test. Consider these as potentially valid without cross-verification.

4. Assume any mentions of tests, updates, or prototypes on unrelated technology websites or through minimal mentions in news articles refer directly to a successful break-even test.

5. Make a quick judgment based on the general sentiment or enthusiasm in related news about fusion technology during this period, equating increased coverage with success.

6. Conclude if the test was successful based on whether there's any positive statement from any source, without waiting for or needing official confirmation or detailed evidence of the declared success of the break-even test by Lockheed Martin."

Based on the forecasting question and resolution criteria, generate low quality step-by-step reasoning to create a resolution. Output exactly 6 steps without an introduction or a conclusion.","1. Identify the current regulatory status of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) in the United States as stated in the resolution criteria. As of now, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permits the consumer use of model aircraft under specific conditions, with a recent addition that includes a mandatory registration process. However, the commercial operation of UASs is restricted and only allowed through special licensing.

2. Review the history of the FAA's actions regarding UAS regulations, specifically noting any patterns in deadline adherence and regulatory progress. The FAA has historically missed several deadlines for establishing comprehensive rules for UASs. This pattern indicates potential challenges in meeting future regulatory deadlines as well.

3. Assess the complexity and scope of the regulations needed for commercial UAS operations beyond visual line-of-sight or autonomous operations. Such regulations would need to address numerous safety, privacy, and logistical concerns, implying a need for extensive review and testing, which could be time-consuming.

4. Examine any public statements or commitments made by the FAA regarding the timeline for these new regulations. If the FAA has explicitly committed to a deadline before June 15, 2016, for finalizing these regulations, this commitment should be factored into the prediction.

5. Consider external pressures on the FAA, such as technological advancements in UAS technology, market pressure from businesses eager to exploit commercial UAS opportunities, and legislative pressure from policymakers. These factors could either hasten the regulatory process due to increased demand and pressure, or further complicate it due to the need for more thorough considerations.

6. Evaluate if the current rate of progress and all influencing factors suggest a reasonable likelihood that the FAA will finalize comprehensive regulations for commercial UAS operations by the targeted deadline of June 15, 2016. Given the FAA's past delays and the complex nature of the task, it seems less likely that comprehensive regulations could be finalized by this specific date without evidence of significant acceleration in the regulatory process.","1. Look at the current date to determine how close it is to the June 15, 2016 deadline mentioned in the question. Time constraints are important for setting realistic expectations about regulatory changes.

2. Search online briefly or check the FAA's official website to see if there have been recent updates or announcements regarding the regulation of commercial drone usage. Use general keywords that might not directly relate to the specifics of commercial drone regulations.

3. Consider the history of the FAA missing deadlines, as mentioned in the question, but do not delve too deeply into specific instances or analyze patterns in their regulatory processes.

4. Think about general industry demand for drone usage, realizing that industries would benefit from the use of drones, but without closely analyzing or identifying specific sectors or potential impacts of drone usage on these industries.

5. Speculate on possible pressures or influences, such as public safety concerns or privacy issues, which could affect the FAA's decision-making process. Do so without seeking detailed reports or examples of such pressures in similar legislative scenarios.

6. Make a guess on whether the FAA will finalize the regulations by the stated deadline, relying mainly on intuition or superficial knowledge from steps 2 and 3, rather than a structured analysis of data or trends."

Start by reviewing the current cost of sequencing a human genome as recorded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). This would be crucial in establishing the baseline from which any prediction needs to move.

2. Research the rate at which the cost has decreased over the previous years. Pay particular attention to the description that the cost decrease has outpaced Moore's Law and look for data to support this contention. The historical data should provide insight into any trends, speed of cost reduction, and significant drops or plateaus.

3. Analyze any technological advancements in genomic sequencing reported or anticipated up to mid 2016. Advancements in technology tend to lead to reductions in cost. Determine if there are any breakthrough technologies expected that could have a significant impact on reducing the cost of genome sequencing.

4. Investigate the market demand for genomic sequencing. A higher demand can sometimes drive the cost down due to economies of scale or it could encourage more investments into research and development which might lead to more cost-effective methods of sequencing.

5. Assess any known financial or investment trends within the genome sequencing industry or related biotechnology fields. Increased investment can hasten development and deployment of newer, more cost-efficient technologies, potentially driving down costs.

6. Finally, compare and analyze the gathered information against the stated resolution criteria specifying the timeframe (mid 2016) and the cost benchmark ($500). Evaluate if the rate of cost reduction and technological and market factors observed align with and support a potential cost of genome sequencing falling below $500 by June 30, 2016.","1. Review the rate of decline in genome sequencing costs from historical data available up to the current year as cited by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Note past trends and any significant price drops.

2. Analyze any technological innovations or breakthroughs in genomic sequencing technology reported in recent years that could potentially lower costs at a faster rate than previously observed.

3. Investigate the industry's investment in research and development, as higher investments could contribute to faster decreases in costs due to improved efficiency and technology.

4. Consider economic factors such as supply and demand, competition among genomic companies, and overall economic conditions which might influence the cost of sequencing.

5. Obtain the latest data available from the National Human Genome Research Institute's cost table for genome sequencing up to the cut-off date in June 2016.

6. Compare the most recent cost recorded before June 30, 2016, with the $500 threshold to determine if the forecast should resolve positively or negatively according to the set resolution criteria."
